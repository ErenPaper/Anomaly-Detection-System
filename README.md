# Anomaly Detection System

This Jupyter notebook implements and compares multiple anomaly detection approaches on real-world credit card transaction data, including statistical, distance-based, and machine learning methods.
I evaluated model performance using standard metrics and created visualizations to support interpretability and analysis, using Python 
with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib in a Jupyter environment on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.
